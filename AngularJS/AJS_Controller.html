AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications.

AngularJS controllers are regular JavaScript Objects.

*** AngularJS Controllers
AngularJS applications are controlled by controllers.

The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.

A controller is a JavaScript Object, created by a standard JavaScript object constructor.

<div ng-app="" ng-controller="personController">
<!  NG-CONTROLLER is actually a JavaScript Object>

Full Name: {{firstName + " " + lastName}}

    $scope.firstName = "John",
