AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.

***AngularJS Expressions

AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions binds data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.



*** AngularJS Directives

AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.

The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application.

The ng-init directive initialize application data.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

Using ng-init is not very common. You will learn how to initialize data in the chapter about controllers.

****

1. The ng-app Directive
The ng-app directive defines the root element of an AngularJS application.

The ng-app directive will auto-bootstrap (automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded.

Later you will learn how ng-app can have a value (like ng-app="myModule"), to connect code modules.

2. The ng-init Directive
The ng-init directive defines initial values for an AngularJS application.

Normally, you will not use ng-init. You will use a controller or module instead.

You will learn more about controllers and modules later.

3. The ng-model Directive
The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

4. The ng-model directive can also:

Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
Bind HTML elements to HTML forms.
The ng-repeat Directive
The ng-repeat directive clones HTML elements once for each item in a collection (in an array).






Data Binding
The {{ firstName }} expression, in the example above, is an AngularJS data binding expression.

Data binding in AngularJS, synchronizes AngularJS expressions with AngularJS data.

{{ firstName }} is synchronized with ng-model="firstName".

In the next example two text fields are synchronized with two ng-model directives:

AngularJS Example

<div ng-app="" ng-init="quantity=1;price=5">

Quantity: <input type="number"	ng-model="quantity">
Costs:    <input type="number" ng-model="price">

Total in dollar: {{ quantity * price }}

</div>
