AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.

AngularJS is distributed as a JavaScript file, and can be added to a web page with a script tag:

<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.26/angular.min.js"></script>

AJS extends HTML by adding "directives" in tags, adding "expression" to bind data to HTML, adding "controller" to control the application  AJS - a package for JS like bootstrap for CSS

***
The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.



AngularJS Expressions
AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions bind data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.

AngularJS will "output" data exactly where the expression is written.

AJS Variable  using ng-init="quantity=1;cost=5"

<div ng-app="" ng-init="quantity=1;cost=5">

<p>Total in dollar: {{ quantity * cost }}</p>

</div>




** example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<script src= "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.26/angular.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

<div ng-app="">
<p>My first expression: {{ 5 + 5 }}</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

AngularJS Expressions
AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions binds data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.

AngularJS will "output" data exactly where the expression is written.

AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}


If you remove the ng-app directive, HTML will display the expression as it is, without solving it.
