XPointer (the XML Pointer language) allows hyperlinks to point to specific parts (fragments) of XML documents.

In this example, we will use XPointer in conjunction with XLink to point to a specific part of another document.

We will start by looking at the target XML document (the document we are linking to):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<dogbreeds>

<dog breed="Rottweiler" id="Rottweiler">
  <picture url="http://dog.com/rottweiler.gif" />
  <history>The Rottweiler's ancestors were probably Roman
  drover dogs.....</history>
  <temperament>Confident, bold, alert and imposing, the Rottweiler
  is a popular choice for its ability to protect....</temperament>
</dog>

<dog breed="FCRetriever" id="FCRetriever">
  <picture url="http://dog.com/fcretriever.gif" />
  <history>One of the earliest uses of retrieving dogs was to
  help fishermen retrieve fish from the water....</history>
  <temperament>The flat-coated retriever is a sweet, exuberant,
  lively dog that loves to play and retrieve....</temperament>
</dog>

Note that the XML document above uses id attributes on each element!

So, instead of linking to the entire document (as with XLink), XPointer allows you to link to specific parts of the document. 

To link to a specific part of a page, add a number sign (#) and an XPointer expression after the URL in the xlink:href attribute, like this: xlink:href="http://dog.com/dogbreeds.xml#xpointer(id('Rottweiler'))". The expression refers to the element in the target document, with the id value of "Rottweiler".
