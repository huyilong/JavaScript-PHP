XQuery and XPointer are both built on XPath expressions. XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 share the same data model and support the same functions and operators.



XQuery is to XML what SQL is to database tables.
XQuery is different from JQuery, which is a shortcut for JavaScript, just as BootStramp for CSS
XQuery is used to query XML data, and its foundation is XPath

XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. These path expressions look very much like the expressions you see when you work with a traditional computer file system. And there are 100+ built-in functions in XPath

XQuery was designed to query XML data.



XQuery 1.0, XPath 2.0, and XSLT 2.0 share the same functions library.
