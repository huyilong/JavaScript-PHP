**** 
The purpose of a DTD (Document Type Definition) is to 
					define the legal building blocks of an XML document.

A DTD defines the document structure with a list of legal elements and attributes.



XML Errors Will Stop You
Errors in XML documents will stop your XML applications.

The W3C XML specification states that a program should stop processing an XML document if it finds an error. The reason is that XML software should be small, fast, and compatible.

HTML browsers will display HTML documents with errors (like missing end tags).

With XML, errors are not allowed.

Why Use a DTD?

With a DTD, your XML files can carry a description of its own format.

With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree on a standard for interchanging data.

With a DTD, you can verify that the data you receive from the outside world is valid.

If you want to study DTD, you will find our DTD tutorial on our homepage.



An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".

*** An XML document validated against a DTD is "Well Formed" and "Valid".
Valid XML Documents
A "Valid" XML document is a "Well Formed" XML document, which also conforms to the rules of a DTD:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "Note.dtd">
<note>
<to>Tove</to>
<from>Jani</from>
<heading>Reminder</heading>
<body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>

The DOCTYPE declaration, in the example above, is a reference to an external DTD file. The content of the file is shown in the paragraph below.

****  XML DTD   (#PCDATA / #CDATA  !!! #PCDATA means parse-able text data.)
The purpose of a DTD is to define the structure of an XML document. It defines the structure with a list of legal elements:

<!DOCTYPE note
[
<!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)>
<!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>
The DTD above is interpreted like this:

!DOCTYPE note defines that the root element of the document is note
!ELEMENT note defines that the note element contains four elements: "to, from, heading, body"
!ELEMENT to defines the to element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT from defines the from element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT heading defines the heading element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT body defines the body element to be of type "#PCDATA"
