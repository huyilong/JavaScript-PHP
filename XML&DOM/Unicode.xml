<!--

Unicode is an industry standard for character encoding of text documents. It deﬁnes (nearly) every possible international character by a name and a number.

Unicode has two variants: UTF-8 and UTF-16.

UTF = Universal character set Transformation Format.

UTF-8 uses 1 byte (8-bits) to represent basic Latin characters, and two, three, or four bytes for the rest.

UTF-16 uses 2 bytes (16 bits) for most characters, and four bytes for the rest.


UTF-8 - The Web Standard
UTF-8 is the standard character encoding on the web.

UTF-8 is the default character encoding for HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and XML.


XML Encoding
The ﬁrst line in an XML document is called the prolog:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
The prolog is optional. Normally it contains the XML version number.

It can also contain information about the encoding used in the document. This prolog specifies UTF-8 encoding:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
//describe the encoding as an attribute inside the first tag for 
//declaring XML coding block

The XML standard states that all XML software must understand both UTF-8 and UTF-16.

UTF-8 is the default for documents without encoding information.
