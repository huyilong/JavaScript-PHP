	What is XML?
	XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language
	XML is designed to be self-descriptive
	XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for carrying information.
	
	Why use XML?
	XML Separates Data from HTML
	If you need to display dynamic data in your HTML document, 
	it will take a lot of work to edit the HTML each time the data changes.
	
	
	With XML, data can be stored in separate XML files.
	
	With a few lines of JavaScript code, you can read an external XML file and update the data 		content of your web page.


	This way you can concentrate on using HTML/CSS for display and layout,
	 and be sure that changes in the underlying data will not require any changes to the HTML.
