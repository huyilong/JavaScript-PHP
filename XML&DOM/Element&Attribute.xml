XML Elements vs. Attributes

in html the attribute is not a part of data:
In HTML, attributes provide additional information about elements:

<img src="computer.gif">
<a href="demo.asp">

attributes often provide information that is not a part of the data. In the example below, the file type is irrelevant to the data, but can be important to the software that wants to manipulate the element:

<file type="gif">computer.gif</file>


but in xml the attribute does not have essential difference with

Take a look at these examples:

<person sex="female">
  <firstname>Anna</firstname>
  <lastname>Smith</lastname>
</person>

<person>
  <sex>female</sex>
  <firstname>Anna</firstname>
  <lastname>Smith</lastname>
</person>

In the first example sex is an attribute. In the last, sex is an element. Both examples provide the same information.

There are no rules about when to use attributes or when to use elements. Attributes are handy in HTML. In XML my advice is to avoid them. Use elements instead.



Well-formed XML must be most expanded:

An expanded date element is used in the third: (THIS IS MY FAVORITE):

<note>
  <date>
    <day>10</day>
    <month>01</month>
    <year>2008</year>
  </date>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
