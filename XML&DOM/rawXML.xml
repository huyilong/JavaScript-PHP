Why Does XML Display Like This?
XML documents do not carry information about how to display the data.

Since XML tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document, browsers do not know if a tag like <table> describes an HTML table or a dining table.

Without any information about how to display the data, most browsers will just display the XML document as it is.

In the next chapters, we will look at different solutions for the display problem, using CSS, XSLT, and JavaScript.



WE CAN USE CSS & XSTL & JAVASCRIPT to solve this problem, which is caused by xml itself not carrying any information about how to display the data
