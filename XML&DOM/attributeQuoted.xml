<!--

	XML documents must contain one element that is the parent of all other elements. This 			element is called the root element.

	<root>
	  <child>
	    <subchild>.....</subchild>
	  </child>
	</root>
	
	
	Comments in XML
	The syntax for writing comments in XML is similar to that of HTML.

	BUT ->
	
	HTML truncates multiple white-space characters to one single white-space:
	With XML, the white-space in a document is not truncated.
