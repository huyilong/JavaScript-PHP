<!--

		the attribute inside the tag must be quoted
		
		An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag 
		to (including) the element's end tag.
		
		An element can contain:
		
		other elements
		text
		attributes
		or a mix of all of the above...
		
		content:   element content &&  text content
		
		In the example above, <bookstore> and <book> have element contents, 
		because they contain other elements. <book> also has an attribute 
		(category="CHILDREN"). <title>, <author>, <year>, and <price> have text 
		content because they contain text.
